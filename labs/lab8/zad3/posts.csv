Piszę posta o tym że wraz z rodziną przeprowadzam się po 17 latach mieszkania w Poznaniu do Gdańska.

Będziemy mieszkać na Morenie i przeprowadzamy się tam 21 czerwca. Dla dzieciaków mam już ogarnięte przedszkole, mieszkanie jest bardzo fajne i jest dość blisko parku krajobrazowego. Wraz z żoną pracujemy z domu więc w sumie to wszystko jedno czy w poznaniu czy w Gdańsku jesteśmy 

Ogólnie słabo znam Gdańsk i mam wielkie oczekiwania, to będzie wielka zmiana w naszym życiu i mam milion planów. Zarówno takich do Gdańska jak i do siebie samego.

Widzałem na mapie że w okolicy mieszkania są baseny więc chciałbym zacząć tam chodzić ... no nie wiem ile ale więcej niż raz w tygodniu, chciałbym objeździć rowerem cały park kraobrazowy i całe miasto. Chcę dużo chodzić do lasu, poznać miasto, chcę zobaczyć wszystkie atrakcje, posiedzieć latem nad morzem a i zobaczyć jak tam jest zimą.

Gdańsk wydaje mi się odrobinę tańszy od Poznania (przedszkole jest tańsze - 2 restauracje w których byłem też ale tak odrobine)

To będzie wielka zmiana dla mnie i rodziny, w Poznniu mamy malutkie mieszkanko i w 4 osoby to wchodzimy tam sobie na głowy a w Gdańsku będziemy mieć większe. Jestem totalnie oczarowany nowym życiem i miejscem w które trafię.

Ogólnie to nie mam żadnych pytań bo sam chcę poznać wszystkie zakamarki Gdańska i okolic, ale jeśli macie do polecenia coś dla nowego mieszkańca co wszystko robi z dziećmi to dajcie znać

Quizzes in English for international groups,6,1cb99hf,gdansk,https://www.reddit.com/r/gdansk/comments/1cb99hf/quizzes_in_english_for_international_groups/,1,"Hi!

Together with colleagues, I organize each month PubQuiz in English. It’s a fun, popular activity inspired by bar quizzes from UK. You can come alone or bring a team, face off with trivia questions, and, of course, the top teams win prizes (drinks, shots, cash). Our next PubQuiz in English is on Wednesday, 24.04.24. (Officyna Vinegre, 20:00)

We throw quizzes in a bunch of cities every month, and sometimes we make themed ones, like this Friday’s extra PubQuiz all about the TV series ""Friends."" Come along with your friends! Any team size works, and you just need a B1 level of English to have a good time.

PubQuiz has three rounds, each with 15 thought-provoking and surprising questions! Guess song titles, recognize movies, and test your general knowledge. It takes about two hours, and each game offers up to five prizes for the best teams (and also for the luckiest one).

If you would like to get to know us better, check out our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1472747406643046) with all events and the website [www.pubquiz.pl/pubquiz-in-english](http://www.pubquiz.pl/pubquiz-in-english)

Questions about relocating to Gdansk,1,1c7w0qo,gdansk,https://www.reddit.com/r/gdansk/comments/1c7w0qo/questions_about_relocating_to_gdansk/,20,"Hi reddit,

I recently accepted an offer from a company in Gdansk and I am trying to do some research in terms of our relocation. The city looks absolutely stunning and Poland always had a special place in my heart, so this feels like a dream come true for me.

It is just me and my wife and we are both in our late 20s. If you can help me with the following questions I would really appreciate it.

1. Where can I look for rentals? I have seen some websites ([olx.pl](https://olx.pl) and [otodom.pl](https://otodom.pl)) but I am not sure about the accuracy of the information I am getting. Are there any big, trust-worthy real-estate agencies that I can talk to (in English)? Or will I have to wait until I am in the city to  look at the rentals more seriously? I don't want any Airbnb style short term deals or anything that is catered to students etc. The plan is to live in the city for the foreseeable future, and possibly indefinitely.
2. Our budget is around 6000 PLN per month for rent. Do you think this is a reasonable number for a flat close to city center? 1 bedroom, a living room and a kitchen is a must, a second study room would be nice but not necessary.
3. Most of the rentals that I have seen seem furnished and probably targeted towards students. I guess this is sort of expected as Gdansk has a lot of students. However, I have heard that in some countries it makes little to no difference in terms of rent whether you have it furnished or not (which is quite surprising TBH). In your opinion, how standard of a procedure to have rentals furnished and would it make a difference if we prefer non-furnished rentals?
4. Can I buy an apartment instead of renting? I believe I would need a permit for this, how hard is it to get this permit?
5. Are there any neighborhoods that you can suggest? I believe living close to the university is always a good idea for young couples, does this idea make sense for Gdansk as well? Are there any neighborhoods to avoid?
6. In you experience, do we need a dryer machine for clothes? In my country, the weather is not that humid so you can dry your clothes using drying racks, but I have heard this was not an option in some other humid countries.
7. What is the food like? What do you guys cook at home for a regular dinner and breakfast?
8. It is more than likely that I am missing a lot of things so what other general suggestions do you have? I am living in a Mediterranean climate (in Turkey to be more specific), are there any major differences that I should know about?

I know I posted a lot of questions but I am not looking for detailed answers to all of them. Any answer or suggestion would be really helpful. Thank you so much for all your answers.",1713530805.0
